# Amazon Product Research Playbook Help

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for using the Amazon Product Research Playbook. This tool transforms product research from guesswork into a systematic, data-driven process.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Guide

**Get from raw data to scored opportunities in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Upload Product Data**: Import your Helium 10 Black Box CSV (no setup required)
2. **Add Keyword Metrics**: Enhance with Magnet/Cerebro data (optional but recommended)
3. **Score & Analyze**: Apply scoring and find your best opportunities

### (A) Preparing Your CSVs in Helium 10

1. Open Helium 10 Black Box
2. Set your search criteria (price range, revenue, reviews, etc.)
3. Run your search and review the results
4. Click **"Export"** â†’ Download as CSV
5. Save the file to your computer

**Step 2: Export Keyword Data (Optional)**

## Scoring System {#scoring-gates} {#scoring-gates}

### How Scoring Works

The scoring system evaluates products across multiple criteria with customizable weights:

1. **Revenue Potential** (25% default weight)
2. **Competition Level** (20% default weight)
3. **Market Demand** (20% default weight)
4. **Profit Margins** (15% default weight)
5. **Review Quality** (10% default weight)
6. **Keyword Difficulty** (10% default weight)

### Scoring Gates

Products are categorized into tiers based on their total score:

- **ðŸŸ¢ Excellent (80-100)**: High-potential opportunities
- **ðŸŸ¡ Good (60-79)**: Solid opportunities worth consideration
- **ðŸ”´ Poor (0-59)**: Lower-priority or risky opportunities

### Customizing Weights

1. Go to the **Score** page
2. Adjust the weight sliders for each criterion
3. Ensure total weights equal 100%
4. Click "Save Configuration" to apply changes

### Understanding Metrics

**Revenue Metrics:**
- Monthly sales volume and revenue estimates

**Target Margins:**

**Example Calculation:**
- Selling Price: $25
- COGS: $8
- FBA Fee: $4
- Freight: $1.50
- Referral Fee: $3.75 (15%)
- Total Costs: $17.25
- Profit: $7.75
- Margin: 31%
